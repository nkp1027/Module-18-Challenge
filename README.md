# Module-18-Challenge
## Description
We will be building a ledger system for blockchain that is simple and easy to use via the streamlit web application. First we create a record data class, then we modify the block data class so that it can store data. Second, we will add user inputs to the streamlit web app and finally test all that we have done and provide the screenshot of the app working as intended.
## Results of Testing
This is the screenshot taken of the ledger working as intended. You can visualize the difficulty sliding bar, the user inputs for sender and receiver ID as well as the amount transacted. There is also a drop down menu in the sidebar that can specify block contents.
